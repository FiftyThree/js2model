High

[x] `to_json` not done yet
[x] Enum initialization from JSON: totally wrong
[x] Enums nested in classes, or placed in root include file, but not in separate includes
[x] Implement `is_valid`
[x] Support "required" array
[x] Support `pattern` for string types
[x] Support min/max for numerics
[x] Rationalize required vs. optional arrays
[x] Array size validation
[x] `to_json` broken for arrays

Medium

[x] Optional parameters should be emitted as boost::optional<T>
[x] More testing around arrays - not sure that's correct

Low

[ ] Could nest schema classes as appropriate
[ ] Add directive to bypass precommit/clang-format
[ ] Ctors that force you to fill all values...maybe. Tends to be annoying when there are many values.
